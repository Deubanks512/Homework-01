Code Refactor

In this assignment I was given a code to refactor that would help increase the website's search engine optimization. 
To start I fixed the broken code for the website's images, and including an alt attribute on the images to provide better sarch engine results. 
Next, I changed the css dementions of each picture and details to fit comfortably and equally within the designated larger blue box for each section. In addition, I condensed the css stylesheet where possible and re-organizing the style sheet to match the order of the html file. In this assignment I waas able to interchanged tags with better suited tags such as including a nav tag, an aside tag along with section and article tags where needed.

Challenges I ran into during this assignment were making sure that I had all of the correct material in the same folder on my computer. Pictures did not populate due to this error, fortuntaley is was a simple fix. 

With every change and challenge I would refernce to the most resent version of the site, making sure change were accurate and errors were caught. Both Visual Studio Code and the Inspector tool were most helpful in this process.
